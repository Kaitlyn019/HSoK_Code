23,Bottom-Up Organizing with Tools from On High: Understanding the Data Practices of Labor Organizers,"This paper provides insight into the use of data tools in the American labor movement by analyzing the practices of staff employed by unions to organize alongside union members. We interviewed 23 field-level staff organizers about how they use data tools to evaluate membership. We find that organizers work around and outside of these tools to develop access to data for union members and calibrate data representations to meet local needs. Organizers mediate between local and central versions of the data, and draw on their contextual knowledge to challenge campaign strategy. We argue that networked data tools can compound field organizers' lack of discretion, making it more difficult for unions to assess and act on the will of union membership. We show how the use of networked data tools can lead to less accurate data, and discuss how bottom-up approaches to data gathering can support more accurate membership assessments.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376185,CHI,2020,,,,,,,
9,Social Engineering Attacks on Government Opponents: Target Perspectives,"New methods of dissident surveillance employed by repressive nation-states increasingly involve socially engineering targets into unwitting cooperation (e.g., by convincing them to open a malicious attachment or link). While a fair amount is understood about the nature of these threat actors and the types of tools they use, there is comparatively little understood about targets’ perceptions of the risks associated with their online activity, and their security posture. We conducted in-depth interviews of 30 potential targets of Middle Eastern and Horn of Africa-based governments, also examining settings and software on their computers and phones. Our engagement illuminates the ways that likely targets are vulnerable to the types of social engineering employed by nation-states.",https://doi.org/10.1515/popets-2017-0022,PoPETS,2017,"Volume 2017, Number 2, April 2017",,"Legal or Political

121,Designing Cyberbullying Mitigation and Prevention Solutions through Participatory Design With Teenagers,"While social media platforms enable individuals to easily communicate and share experiences, they have also emerged as a tool for cyberbullying. Teenagers represent an especially vulnerable population for negative emotional responses to cyberbullying. At the same time, attempts to mitigate or prevent cyberbullying from occurring in these networked spaces have largely failed because of the complexity and nuance with which young people bully others online. To address challenges related to designing for cyberbullying intervention and mitigation, we detail findings from participatory design work with two groups of high school students in spring 2015. Over the course of five design sessions spanning five weeks, participants shared their experiences with cyberbullying and iteratively designed potential solutions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the range of cyberbullying mitigation solutions participants designed. We focus on challenges participants' identified in designing for cyberbullying support and prevention and present a set of five potential cyberbullying mitigation solutions based on the results of the design sessions.",https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858548,CHI,2016,Affording Collective Action in Social Media,,Knowledge (children and teens),"Social strategies (school administration)

55,Angel or Devil? A Privacy Study of Mobile Parental Control Apps,"Android parental control applications are used by parents to monitor and limit their children’s mobile behaviour (e.g., mobile apps usage, web browsing, calling, and texting). In order to offer this service, parental control apps require privileged access to system resources and access to sensitive data. This may significantly reduce the dangers associated with kids’ online activities, but it raises important privacy concerns. These concerns have so far been overlooked by organizations providing recommendations regarding the use of parental control applications to the public.",https://doi.org/10.2478/popets-2020-0029,PoPETS,2020,"Volume 2020, Number 2, April 2020",,,,,"great paper however, doesn't talk to users, I don't think it belongs in our sample.",
40,Co-designing Mobile Online Safety Applications with Children,"Parents use mobile monitoring software to observe and restrict their children's activities in order to minimize the risks associated with Internet-enabled mobile devices. As children are stakeholders in such technologies, recent research has called for their inclusion in its design process. To investigate children's perceptions of parental mobile monitoring technologies and explore their interaction preferences, we held two co-design sessions with 12 children ages 7-12. Children first reviewed and redesigned an existing mobile monitoring application. Next, they designed ways children could use monitoring software when they encounter mobile risks (e.g., cyberbullying, inappropriate content). Results showed that children acknowledged safety needs and accepted certain parental controls. They preferred and designed controls that emphasized restriction over monitoring, taught risk coping, promoted parent-child communication, and automated interactions. Our results benefit designers looking to develop parental mobile monitoring technologies in ways that children will both accept and can actively benefit from.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174097,CHI,2018,Paper Presentations,,"Reliance on a third party

Recent work has identified specific physical privacy concerns of this population and explored how emerging technology, such as wearable devices, could help. In this study we investigated their physical safety and security concerns and behaviors by conducting interviews (N=19) with participants who have visual impairments in the greater San Francisco metropolitan area. Our participants' detailed accounts shed light on (1) the safety and security concerns of people with visual impairments in urban environments (such as feared and real instances of assault); (2) their behaviors for protecting physical safety (such as avoidance and mitigation strategies); and (3) refined design considerations for future assistive wearable devices that could enhance their awareness of surrounding threats.",https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2016/technical-sessions/presentation/ahmed,SOUPS,2016,Privacy,,"Resource or time constrained (atms don't work for them etc.)

128,Evaluating the Contextual Integrity of Privacy Regulation: Parents' IoT Toy Privacy Norms Versus COPPA,"Increased concern about data privacy has prompted new and updated data protection regulations worldwide. However, there has been no rigorous way to test whether the practices mandated by these regulations actually align with the privacy norms of affected populations. Here, we demonstrate that surveys based on the theory of contextual integrity provide a quantifiable and scalable method for measuring the conformity of specific regulatory provisions to privacy norms. We apply this method to the U.S. Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), surveying 195 parents and providing the first data that COPPA‚Äôs mandates generally align with parents‚Äô privacy expectations for Internet-connected ""smart"" children‚Äôs toys. Nevertheless, variations in the acceptability of data collection across specific smart toys, information types, parent ages, and other conditions emphasize the importance of detailed contextual factors to privacy norms, which may not be adequately captured by COPPA.",https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/apthorpe,USENIX,2019,Protecting Users Everywhere,,Access to a sensitive resource or person (being the parent of a kid),"Technical solutions

124,DatashareNetwork: A Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Search Engine for Investigative Journalists,"Investigative journalists collect large numbers of digital documents during their investigations. These documents can greatly benefit other journalists' work. However, many of these documents contain sensitive information. Hence, possessing such documents can endanger reporters, their stories, and their sources. Consequently, many documents are used only for single, local, investigations. We present DatashareNetwork, a decentralized and privacy-preserving search system that enables journalists worldwide to find documents via a dedicated network of peers. DatashareNetwork combines well-known anonymous authentication mechanisms and anonymous communication primitives, a novel asynchronous messaging system, and a novel multi-set private set intersection protocol (MS-PSI) into a decentralized peer-to-peer private document search engine. Using a prototype implementation, we show that DatashareNetwork is secure and scales to thousands of users and millions of documents.",https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/edalatnejad,USENIX,2020,Specific User Populations,,,,,purely applied crypto and implementation details.

67,"Fragile Masculinity: Men, Gender, and Online Harassment","Harassment is a persistent problem in contemporary online environments, with women disproportionately experiencing its most severe forms. While critical scholars posit that online gender harassment may be linked to men's anxieties about fulfilling normative masculine gender roles, this relationship has not been examined by empirical research. We survey 264 young men between the ages of 18-24 about their masculinity anxieties and their perceptions of harassment directed at a woman on Twitter. We find that men who perceive themselves as less masculine than average men report higher endorsement of harassment. Further, we find that the relationship between masculinity anxieties and harassment endorsement is mediated by men's adherence to masculine norms and toxic disinhibition. We interpret these results through the lens of social media's specific affordances, and we discuss their implications for technology designers and other practitioners who wish to better detect, prevent, and remediate online harassment by accounting for the role of gender.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376645,CHI,2020,,,"Oppressed or stigmatized by adversaries

118,Privacy Considerations when Designing Social Network Systems to Support Successful Ageing,"A number of interventions exist to support older adults in ageing well and these typically involve support for an active and sociable ageing process. We set out to examine the privacy implications of an intervention that would monitor mobility and share lifestyle and health data with a community of trusted others. We took a privacy-by-design approach to the system in the early stages of its development, working with older adults to firstly understand their networks of trust and secondly understand their privacy concerns should information be exchanged across that network. We used a Johari Windows framework in the thematic analysis of our data, concluding that the social sharing of information in later life carried significant risk. Our participants worried about the social signaling associated with data sharing and were cautious about a system that had the potential to disrupt established networks.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025861,CHI,2017,Older Adults and Computers,,"Resource or time constrained

16,"Of Ulti, 'hajano', and ""Matachetar otanetak datam"": Exploring Local Practices of Exchanging Confidential and Sensitive Information in Urban Bangladesh","Strategies of hiding information over communication media have long been an interest of CSCW and related communities. Most of the studies in this area have focused on various computational means of data protection and their vulnerabilities, and occasionally on social practices situated in the West. However, communities in the Global South often have a rich trove of vernacular arts and crafts of hiding information that might be leveraged to design novel kinds of privacy-preserving technologies. In this paper, we present findings from our three-month long original ethnographic work with various communities in Dhaka, Bangladesh that reveal a wide range of culturally embedded techniques of hiding confidential and sensitive information from their 'others'. Our analysis demonstrates the dynamic nature of these techniques, the learning process associated with them, and their deep relationship with contextual politics that these communities are embedded in. We further connect our findings to the broader interests of CSCW around otherness, ethics, and democracy, and also discuss their implications for design.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3359275,CSCW,2019,"Volume 3, Number CSCW, November 2019",,"Resource or time constrained (probably)

43,Self-Confidence Trumps Knowledge: A Cross-Cultural Study of Security Behavior,"Computer security tools usually provide universal solutions without taking user characteristics (origin, income level, ...) into account. In this paper, we test the validity of using such universal security defenses, with a particular focus on culture. We apply the previously proposed Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) to 3,500 participants from seven countries. We first translate the scale into seven languages while preserving its reliability and structure validity. We then build a regression model to study which factors affect participants' security behavior. We find that participants from different countries exhibit different behavior. For instance, participants from Asian countries, and especially Japan, tend to exhibit less secure behavior. Surprisingly to us, we also find that actual knowledge influences user behavior much less than user self-confidence in their computer security knowledge. Stated differently, what people think they know affects their security behavior more than what they do know.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025926,CHI,2017,Precautionary Behaviors,,,,,No interaction with participants other than a privacy survey.

We interviewed 44 participants at the public computer lab in a marginalized community, and also interviewed 33 university students. In this paper, we report our preliminary quantitative and qualitative findings on what factors may affect the decision to adopt security software.",https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2017/workshop-program/wips2017/jung,SOUPS,2017,Paper Talks 3,,,,,very limited text (just slides) can't make accurate judgements. ,
18,Privacy Unraveling Around Explicit HIV Status Disclosure Fields in the Online Geosocial Hookup App Grindr,"mHealth applications (""apps"") must be searched for and downloaded prior to use, creating a potential barrier to uptake. Integrating health interventions into existing online social environments removes this barrier. However, little is known about the effects of linking sensitive health information to existing online identities. Our qualitative analysis of online comments (n=192) explores the user views of an HIV intervention integrated into the geosocial hookup app Grindr. We find some HIV positive users report keeping their status private to reduce their stigma exposure, whilst others report publicly disclosing their status to avoid being stigmatised by others. Where users keep their status private, we find concerns that social assumptions may develop around these non-disclosures, creating a privacy unraveling effect which restricts disclosure choice. Using Peppet's four proposed limits to privacy unraveling, we develop a set of descriptive conceptual designs to explore the privacy respecting potential of these limits within this context and propose further research to address this privacy challenge.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3274450,CSCW,2018,"Volume 2, Number CSCW, November 2018",,"Oppressed or stigmatized by adversaries

However, little is known about whether and how teens communicate with their parents when online risks do occur. In a two-month, web-based diary study of 68 teen-parent pairs, participants provided separate accounts of the teens' weekly online risk experiences. We found that most teens had little or no communication with their parents regarding their online risk experiences, and parents and teens shared very different perceptions and reactions when risks were reported, helping explain why communication was so poor. We discuss the implications of our results and make recommendations for how researchers and designers may work to improve the state of family communication regarding adolescent online risks in the future.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2998236,CSCW,2017,Teens &amp; Children,,"Susceptibility to radicalization or risk-seeking

80,Safety vs. Surveillance: What Children Have to Say about Mobile Apps for Parental Control,"Mobile applications (""apps"") developed to promote online safety for children are underutilized and rely heavily on parental control features that monitor and restrict their child's mobile activities. This asymmetry in parental surveillance initiates an interesting research question -- how do children themselves feel about such parental control apps? We conducted a qualitative analysis of 736 reviews of 37 mobile online safety apps from Google Play that were publicly posted and written by children (ages 8-19). Our results indicate that child ratings were significantly lower than that of parents with 76% of the child reviews giving apps a single star. Children felt that the apps were overly restrictive and invasive of their personal privacy, negatively impacting their relationships with their parents. We relate these findings with HCI literature on mobile online safety, including broader literature around privacy and surveillance, and outline design opportunities for online safety apps.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173698,CHI,2018,Paper Presentations,,"Knowledge

42,It wasn't really about the Pokémon: Parents' Perspectives on a Location-Based Mobile Game,"Though prior work shows parents worry about screen media experiences displacing physical activity and time outdoors, this research does not account for location-based mobile games like Pokémon GO, which specifically facilitate outdoor activity. To fill this gap in the research, we surveyed and interviewed parents to understand (1) their values and perceptions of this type of gameplay and (2) how they co-play Pokémon GO with their children. Our findings provide empirical evidence that, in addition to appreciating the increased exercise and time outdoors, parents valued how play led to family bonding experiences. Furthermore, some traditional concerns about screen time persisted in this context, and new concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged. Parents mitigated these concerns with rules and gameplay choices, such as maintaining control of the mobile device, to ensure children were safe. This work contributes an empirical understanding of families as co-users of technology and offers a generative lens to study and design for joint media engagement among family members where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025761,CHI,2017,Novel Game Interfaces,,"Knowledge
